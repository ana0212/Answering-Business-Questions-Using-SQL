# Answering Business Questions Using SQL

- In this project, we answered business questions about a fictional digital music shop (Chinook) that just signed a deal with a new record label.
- Our goal was to answer the questions to provide the necessary knowledge about customers, sales, and employees of the digital music shop to our new partner.
- In the Exploratory Data Analysis section, we answered six questions about the store, we'll list the answers that we found:
1) Between the list of four that we receive, we should choose: Red Tone (Punk); Slim Jim Bites (Blues); Meteor, and the Girls (Pop). Besides that, we recommend looking for artists and albums in the Rock genre, that represent more than 50% of the US sales.
2) We can see that the total sales of each employee are balanced, but we should consider that the employee that sells the most (Jane Peacock) was hired six months before the third employee (Steve Johnson).
3) Analyzing the total of sales and the number of customers of all countries, the USA takes the lead in both categories.
4) Album purchases represent 18.6% of the sales. Based on this data, we recommend to keep purchasing the whole album, so we don't lose almost a fifth of our sales.
5) Looking at the top 10 artists with more playlists, we can see that there is not an expressive number (7 for the number one) that could lead to a change in the marketing strategy towards these artists.
6) We found that 48,4% of the tracks of the chinook store weren't sold. This number is pretty high and represents a big problem for the business.
- After creating the queries to answer the questions, we converted them into pandas dataframes to create graphs and visualize it.
